pyobjcryst - Python bindings to the ObjCryst++ Object-Oriented
Crystallographic Library

| Software version |release|.
| Last updated |today|.

================
Authors
================

`pyobjcryst` was written as part of the DANSE_ open-source project by
Christopher Farrow, Pavol Juh√°s, and Simon J.L. Billinge.
The sources are now maintained as a part of the DiffPy-CMI complex
modeling initiative at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.

Further developments including the ability to index and refine
powder patterns, solve and display crystal structures, using the
global optimisation and least squares algorithms (see the
:doc:`examples/index`) are provided by Vincent Favre-Nicolin (ESRF).

======================================
Installation
======================================

`pyobjcryst` and `libobjcryst` conda packages can be easily installed under
Linux and macOS using channel `conda-forge` or `diffpy` channels,
e.g.:

  * `conda install -c diffpy libobjcryst pyobjcryst`
  * `conda install -c conda-forge libobjcryst pyobjcryst`

See the `README <https://github.com/diffpy/pyobjcryst#requirements>`_
file included with the distribution for more details.

======================================
Usage
======================================

`pyobjcryst` can be used in different ways:

* **as a backend library** to manage crystal structures description in an application
  like `DiffPy-CMI <https://www.diffpy.org/products/diffpycmi/index.html>`_
* **in python scripts or notebooks**, allowing to:

  * display crystal structures,
  * index and refine powder diffraction patterns
  * solve crystal structures from diffraction data using global optimisation algorithms
  * etc..

  The functionality is similar to what is available in `Fox <http://fox.vincefn.net>`_.
  See the :doc:`examples/index`:

  * :doc:`3D Crystal structure display <examples/crystal_3d_widget>`
  * :doc:`Solving the cimetidine structure from its powder pattern <examples/structure-solution-powder-cimetidine>`
  * :doc:`Solving the PbSO4 structure from its X and N powder patterns <examples/structure-solution-powder-pbso4>`
  * :doc:`Meta-structure solution using multi-processing <examples/structure-solution-multiprocessing>`
  * :doc:`Quantitative phase analysis (QPA) <examples/Quantitative-phase-analysis>`

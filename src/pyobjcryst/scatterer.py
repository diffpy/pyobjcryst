"""Python wrapping of Scatterer.h.

See the online ObjCryst++ documentation (https://objcryst.readthedocs.io).

Changes from ObjCryst::Scatterer

- C++ methods that can return const or non-const objects return non-const
  objects in python.
- Operator string() is not exposed.
- Internal use only methods have not been exposed.
- InitRefParList is not exposed, as it is not used inside of Scatterer.
- GetClockScattCompList is exposed using a workaround, because it is not
  implemented in the library.
- Methods related to visualization are not exposed.
